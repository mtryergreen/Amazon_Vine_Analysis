# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Context
Amazon Vine is a service that manufactureres and publishers to recieve reviews for their products, essentially giving them feedback. 
Some companies pay a fee to Amazon, then give products to Amazon Vine members, who are required to then write a review. As they are being paid to review products, and perhaps are motivated to provide more favorable reviews so they can stay on these lists, perhaps some bias will exist amongst these Amazon Vine Members. 

## Objective
This assignment had me analyze consumer reviews to see if there was any bias towards favorable reviews from Vine Members in my dataset. I utilized a dataset on video game reviews withing the U.S. 

## Results
Although I was not able connect AWS with pgAdmin, I did my best with the rest of the data. It appears that there is a bias for Vine Reviews, as they have a more favorable (51%) portion of 5 star reviews whereas unpaid reviews had a much lesser percentage (38%) of 5 star  reviews.

## Further Recommendations 
We could analyze the ratings that reviews other than 5 stars had to see if biases result in a love it or hate it (5 star versus 1 star) trend.
